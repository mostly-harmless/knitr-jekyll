### How to serve Jekyll Websites 

Yihui's [blog post](http://yihui.name/knitr-jekyll/2014/09/jekyll-with-knitr.html)

Yihui's [repo example](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-jekyll)

1. Install knitr and servr (need to use source for now)
2. Install jekyll1. Fork the repo to your own account (click Fork)
3. Clone repo to your computer (use ssh) 
4. Create an Rmd file in the _source directory
6. Change the title so the name starts with the date (see Yihui's posts in the _source directory)
7. Run servr::jekyll(). Actually, you may want to use servr::jekyll(daemon=TRUE) to avoid blocking the console
8. Figure out the url for the gh pages
9. Todo: figure out how to set this up for the gh-pages of an existing repo where you want to create webpages rather than posts

### How to clone to Rstudio so you can actually commit

Make sure to use ssh to clone and not https. In case you did, like me, you can fix this using the command below.

`git remote set-url origin git@git@github.com:mostly-harmless/knitr-jekyll.git`

The [source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6565357/git-push-requires-username-and-password) of this insight ...

## Install

As of the date of this post the version of `servr` on CRAN is 0.1 so ... you need to build
from source.


{% highlight r %}
install.packages(
  c('servr', 'knitr'),
  type = 'source',
  repos = c('http://yihui.name/xran', 'http://cran.rstudio.com')
)

# Just to double check
packageVersion('servr') 
{% endhighlight %}

For Windows users, you have to make sure `jekyll` can be found from your environment variable `PATH`, i.e., R can call it via `system('jekyll')`. This is normally not an issue for Linux or Mac OS X users (`gem install jekyll` is enough). I assume the same commands works on windows to install jekyll but then you have to figure out how to update the path.
